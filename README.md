# Grinner Prompts
An repository with several cool (or weird) prompts you can send to "enchance" your experience in ChatGPT.
The prompts in this repository may change completely the current chat you send it to, and most probably that you cannot reverse the mode and will have to create another chat in order to get it back to normal.


## Why create this
A fun way to mess with ChatGPT is with these type of prompts, and adds a bit more variety, every prompt (atleast added by me) was made by me.

## It seems your prompt does not work
If one of the prompts here does not work, it means one thing, or its non functional (not on purpose lol) since i released it, or it became non functional after some update on ChatGPT.
Your you are just unlucky and have to send it to ChatGPT 3 more times so it will work...
